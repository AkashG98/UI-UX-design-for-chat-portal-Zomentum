# UI-UX-design-for-chat-portal-Zomentum
A UI design for a chat application portal designed in HTML , CSS and Javascript.
In this when you laod the chat.html file , you shall see a blank chat window initally , but as you type messages down , they are appended on the screen .
The appending is done in alternating pattern i.e. the first message appended is from your side and second from the other person's side and the same way it continues.
just go through this basic layout , I hope you all like it.
